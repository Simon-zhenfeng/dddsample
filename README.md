DDDSample
===========
Welcome to DDDSample's new home!

DDDSample is a sample application created as an example of what a slice of a fully
functional Domain-Driven Design application can look like.

We are currently in the process of moving in here at GitHub. So far we have moved
the code here, but please refere to our old home for documentation for now:
http://dddsample.sf.net.

Our plan is to bring the app up-to-date with current technology and adjust things
to align better with the DDD community's view of things that have change over the
years since the sample app was first created. Please stay tuned!
